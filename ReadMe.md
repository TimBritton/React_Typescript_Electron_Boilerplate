Readme for  React Typescript Electron Boilerplate
====

I created this boilerplate project because I needed to understand how stack works.

I based this code off of the React Tutorial on the Typescript website [Here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html).  

I then added the entry_point.js file to start electron for the resulting files of the webpack command.

I will update this readme further when I find out how the stack works.
